# comparing-repos

## Most starred repos on GithubÂ¶

My goal for this program is to visualize which are the most starred repos on Github for different programming languages, 
and to see how many contributors those repos have (and how that number changes through time).

I have reached my API limit (60 calls per hour) with this project, and I need to learn more about this before I can finish this, so now this is __ON HOLD__.

I would have to create a database to store the results after running the program regularly (daily? / weekly?) and then I would be able to see how
this graphs change through time. So to make it interesting, I would have to store my results for a year (to see something interesting/some real changes) and then
plot and "consider it complete". I'll get back to this eventually, just not right now.
